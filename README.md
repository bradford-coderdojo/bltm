# Bacon Lettuce Tomato Mayo

# Project Aims
Create a website.
Create a platforming game - I already have an idea for a really difficult one that I have made before. Look for 8 bit images on the internet to get an idea as to how we are going to draw the 8 bit sprites.


# Project Description

A platforming game which the characters are Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato. The enemy is the mayonaise (perhaps mayonaise cannon shooting at the BLT?), (it will splat the BLT?). The boss level is a fork or a knife?, or a sesame seed bun trying to crush them.
Make giant raining tomatoes and bacon missiles.
